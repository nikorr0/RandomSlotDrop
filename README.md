# RandomSlotDrop
**RandomSlotDrop** is a plugin for the Paper/Purpur/Spigot/Bukkit servers (Minecraft Java Edition 1.17 - 1.21.*).  

The plugin allows players to keep a portion of their inventory upon death. It introduces a configurable chance for dropping only a certain percent of random inventory slots, giving players a better experience by reducing frustration from losing everything after death.

## Functional overview

* **Configurable slot drops**<br>
Only a specific percentage of inventory slots are randomly selected to drop upon player death.
For example, suppose the `dropSlotsPercent` is set to 10%. Since players have a total of 41 inventory slots (36 general slots + 4 armor slots + off-hand slot), the plugin calculates 10% of 41, resulting in approximately 4 random slots chosen to drop items. If a player has items in only 10 of slots, then up to 4 slots might drop items or none at all if the randomly selected slots are empty.

* **Partial stack drops**<br>
For each selected slot containing more than one item, the plugin will randomly choose a partial stack size to drop, within a configured range (from `stackDropPercentMin`% to `stackDropPercentMax`% of the stack). If you set both the min and max to 100, the entire stack will always drop.

* **Drop full inventory on spectator gamemode**<br>
Optionally, if a player dies and is switched to spectator mode shortly afterward, their entire inventory will automatically drop (configured via `spectatorFullDrop`).
